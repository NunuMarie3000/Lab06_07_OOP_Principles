# Lab06_07_OOP_Principles

This lab will be completed in 2 parts:

- Lab 06
- Lab 07

## Introduction

This project is my lab06, and future lab07 homework assignment for Code 401. It is meant to further strengthen my understanding of Object Oriented Programming in C#. It will be a deeper dive into the pillars of OOP in C#: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Create your own technical documentation

- Breakdown and define each of the OOP principles in your own words.

## Provide under each OOP definition a couple (you do not have to define all) of examples of how you are applying this into your project.
